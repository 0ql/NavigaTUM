# Webclient

This folder contains the JavaScript based webclient for NavigaTUM.

## Getting started
### Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

### Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

Ensure that _NavigaTUM-server_ is running in the background.
By default the webclient will connect to the server on `http://localhost:8080`.
If you want to connect to the public API instead, change `api_prefix` in `config-local.js` to `https://nav.tum.sexy/api/` and rebuild.

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint

## Build files & Serving release build

Gulp creates a lot of index HTML files in the build process.
Each of those files are similar but differ in some aspects.
If you serve the release build with a webserver (such as Apache or Nginx) you need
to select the correct files based on the request URL and headers.

```plain
index-view-<view>-<theme>-<lang>.html
            â†‘      â†‘       â†‘
            â”‚      â”‚       â””â”€â”€ The page language. Either "de" or "en" at the
            â”‚      â”‚           moment. It should be selected based on the
            â”‚      â”‚           "lang" Cookie or else the "Accept-Language" header.
            â”‚      â””â”€â”€ The page theme. Either "light" or "dark" at the moment.
            â”‚          It should be selected based on the "theme" Cookie and is
            â”‚          "light" by default.
            â””â”€â”€ The first loaded view (see architecture below). It does technically
                not matter which view is selected here, but this allows to efficiently
                preload resources and optimize the order of resources during initial
                pageload.
```

When running locally on a development build you can use the language and theme of
your choice as well as any view.

## Architecture

The NavigaTUM webclient is made as a single-page application based on [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/). The CSS framework is [Spectre.css](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/). It is made up of a core codebase, _views_ and _modules_:

### Directory structure (only the important parts)

```plain
webclient
â”œâ”€â”€ public/         # ðŸ ” Static assets such as icons, which cannot get inlined
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ codegen/    # ðŸ ” code generated via openapi.yaml for typechecking reasons
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/     # ðŸ ” Static assets such as icons
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ md/                 # ðŸ ” Static pages written in markdown. Served at `/about/<filename>`.
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ variables.scss      # ðŸ ” Include-script for Spectre.CSS
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.scss           # ðŸ ” Sass CSS code for all non-view parts
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ spectre-all.scss    # ðŸ ” Include-script for Spectre.CSS
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ logo.svg            # ðŸ ” Our Logo
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/ # ðŸ ” Vue components, which are used in views.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ views/      # ðŸ ” The views are parts of App.vue, which are loaded dynamically based on our routes.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routes./      # ðŸ ” The views are parts of App.vue, which are loaded dynamically based on our routes.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.vue     # ðŸ ” Main view
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.ts     # ðŸ ” Inialization of Vue.js. This is the entrypoint of our app, from which App.vue and associated Views/Components are loaded
â”œâ”€â”€ vite.config.ts  # ðŸ ” Build configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ gulpfile.js     # ðŸ ” Gulp configuration
â””â”€â”€ package.json    # ðŸ ” Node package definition and dependencies
```

Note that new views are automatically included in the build, but they are not routed.
To add a new view, you need to add a new route in `src/router.ts`.
